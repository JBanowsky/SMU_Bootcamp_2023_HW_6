06-Python-APIs/Submission

This activity is the SMU Boot Camp Module 6 Challenge. 
In this module had two parts to the assignments:

1st) WeatherPy: Use the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to create a representative model of weather across cities.

2nd) VacationPy: Use the geoViews Python library and the Geoapify API to create maps of cites and ideal vacation spots.

Most of the code was resourced by the SMU Bootcamp material.
